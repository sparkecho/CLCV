# CLCV: Common Lisp Computer Vision Library.
   This is an attemption of building a computer vision library for Common Lisp.

## Declaration
As this project is supposed to be too huge, it's better to start from a small project(dip). And this project won't update for a time.

If you are interested in this project, please do have a look at the project [dip](project-dip).

## Introduction
   It was inspired by [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), but limited by my ability and effort, it may takes a long time to finish even the basic part.

   So you can consider it as a personal experiment repertory. The author is not an expert, **PRs are not accepted right now**. But feel free to use the code.

   Hope it would be mature as soon as possible.
