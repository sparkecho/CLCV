# CLCV: Common Lisp Computer Vision Library.
   This is an attempt of building a computer vision library for Common Lisp.

   It was inspired by [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), but limited by my ability and effort
it may takes a long time to finish even the basic part.

   So you can just think it as a personal experiment repertory.

   Hope it would be mature as soon as possible.
